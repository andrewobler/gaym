## Creating a game engine in the Windows command line

-----------------------

Inspired by projects such as [Cataclysm DDA](https://cataclysmdda.org) and
[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/), and by utilities such as
[ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html), **gaym** is a mission to construct
a functional (and hopefully efficient) game engine from scratch, completely within the Windows
command line.

## Why?
Why not? Limitations breed creativity. Plus, it is interesting to theorize about
how far the command line can be pushed while still producing compelling visual results.
